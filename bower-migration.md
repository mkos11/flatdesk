As you might have noticed, we started recommending [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) as an alternative to Bower for **new** front-end projects. Main reasons are straightforward and written on its home page:

1.  Yarn uses checksums to verify the integrity of every installed package (like npm@5)
2.  Yarn uses lockfile to exactly reproduce installed packages each time (like npm@5)
3.  Yarn supports most features npm supports, and is able to force flattening of dependencies

So far it just wasn’t obvious how one could use Yarn for **legacy** Bower projects. Indeed, until recently Yarn neither could install Bower packages (i.e. GitHub repositories without `package.json`) nor resolve semver ranges on git tags. I focused on this [for](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/pull/3624) [a](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/pull/3701) [while](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/pull/3855) and the result is pleasing: **Yarn 1.x is able to install most of Bower packages**. But there’s a catch: it cannot resolve Bower dependencies.

But this is probably for the best as a) Yarn is meant as npm’s replacement b) one must admit npm’s CommonJS module ecosystem is [better integrated](https://medium.com/@trek/last-week-i-had-a-small-meltdown-on-twitter-about-npms-future-plans-around-front-end-packaging-b424dd8d367a) than Bower’s globals/AMD modules c) Module authors currently suffer from supporting two module ecosystems (and dist files in repositories).

Admitting this doesn’t change the fact that it’s difficult to migrate a project that uses globals/AMD components to CommonJS all at once. Ideally you’d be able to install such project with Yarn as-is, and only then gradually replace AMD modules with CommonJS/ES6 equivalents. Solution: [**bower-away**](https://github.com/sheerun/bower-away).

### [§](https://bower.io/blog/2017/how-to-migrate-away-from-bower//#how-it-works)How it works?

Yarn is not only unable to resolve dependencies of Bower components (i.e. dependencies defined in `bower.json`, it looks just for ones in `package.json`), it also cannot translate names of Bower components to URLs of repositories as [described in previous blogpost](https://bower.io/blog/2017/how-to-drop-bower-support/#why-step-4). `bower-away` gets away with this by resolving all dependencies with Bower, and adding all of them **flattened** to `package.json`.

The result is something as follows:

```
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@bower_components/almond" : "jrburke/almond#~0.2.9",
    "@bower_components/angular" : "angular/bower-angular#^1.0.8",
    "@bower_components/d3" : "mbostock-bower/d3-bower#~3.3.10"
  }
}
```

Now, if you install this `package.json` with Yarn, `node_modules/@bower_components` will contain all components in exactly the same way they would be installed by Bower (sans generated `.bower.json`).

And not only that, if some component supports CommonJS interface, you can employ [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for precompiling and require it as so: `const almond = require('@bower_components/almond')`.

For components that don’t support CommonJS, you can find their CommonJS equivalents and add them to project: `yarn add d3@~3.3.10`, then require as usual `const d3 = require('d3')`

But initially, the only change required in code is to change any reference to `bower_components` with `node_modules/@bower_components` (though you can link it somewhere else in postinstall script).
