    "The main issues revolved around:\n",
    "1. Invalid action inputs in the YAML configuration (`GITHUB_TOKEN`, `ref`).\n",
    "2. Errors related to permissions and access tokens.\n",
    "3. Bower to Yarn migration.\n",

    "### YAML Configuration Issues\n",
    "#### Invalid 'ref' input\n",
    "The `ref` input error was likely due to the wrong placement of the `ref` parameter in the YAML file. Following the example from the official documentation, `ref` should be used within `actions/checkout@v2` and set to `${{ github.head_ref }}` to work with `pull_request` events. \n",
    "#### Invalid 'GITHUB_TOKEN' input\n",
    "The `GITHUB_TOKEN` issue seems to be a red herring. The YAML configuration doesn't explicitly require this token, and its automatic injection by GitHub should suffice for most actions.\n",

    "You've provided extensive permissions for your token, covering most, if not all, required accesses. However, the issue could be with the token's scope or with how the token is being used within the workflow. Since you've used a custom token named `MEGA_LINTER`, ensure it has all the necessary permissions. The token must be passed properly to all actions requiring it.\n",

    "A Bower to Yarn migration is being considered. For this, a proper `bower.json` file is needed to convert it to a `package.json` file using the `bower-away` repo. This migration is separate from the Mega-Linter issues but is part of the project's larger scope.\n",

    "3. Ensure you have a valid `bower.json` for the Bower to Yarn migration.\n",
